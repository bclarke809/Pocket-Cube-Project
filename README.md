Code to solve a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube in the shortest number of moves

There are 2 separate codes here. The first to use is the Pocket Cube Combinations Code, which creates a text file that will list every possible combination, along with a leading number that is the key to solving the cube in its shortest number of moves from any position.

Once this file is created, it needs to be added to the repository of the second code (Pocket Cube Solver).
Note: If the code says "File_Test.txt", it should be replaced with "Pocket Cube Output.txt"

This second cube uses the manual input of mixing up the cube, then finds where the final arrangement is in the Pocket Cube Output textfile. From there, it can reverse engineer it and tell you how to solve the cube in less than 12 moves.
